I had created webpages for Auditorium Booking Management Website. These webpages will show the auditoriumâ€™s available in the University of Hyderabad where Admin can book the auditoriums for the Events / Talks / Webinars on specified date and time slots. The admin can add the details of the new auditoriums if any available in the university. Customer and Admin can check the booking details whether the Booking is successful or not by customer mobile number. If the booking is successful, it displays the booking details, else it Displays a message that No bookings found with the entered mobile Number.
